# cater

~~Used to be esoteric~~ primitive programming language made just for fun. Heavily inspired by assembly (even though it's much simpler and in no way comparable to it)

## syntax

As of now the available operations are quite limited.

The "correct" syntax would be:

``OP ARG1 ARG2 ...`` (e.g. ``INC EAX``)
*everything should be written in caps, kinda like SQL*

## requirements

Tested on Python 3.10.4, older version may not work because of the use of new language features (e.g. match)

I tried to use as little third party library as I could but in the future of this project I may need to use them.

## help

If **YOU NEED** help, well the best thing to do is to just read the source code because a complete documentation is not out *yet*.

If **YOU WANT** to help, pull requests are always accepted. To report a bug just open a issue.
